# GoogleWebDesign-Storybook
(2024)

A UI/UX-focused interactive storybook built with **Google Web Designer**, blending animation and storytelling with over **100 pages**. But im ngl I focused more on the storyplot than the actual interactivity which resulted in 70 pages animated remake of ["Rabbit Stew"](https://www.scaryforkids.com/rabbit-stew/) instead.

**Features**
- 100+ animated pages  
- Interactive UI/UX concepts  
- Web-optimized visual storytelling  

**Requirements**
- [Google Web Designer](https://webdesigner.withgoogle.com/) (latest version)
- Google Chrome or any modern browser (Chrome preferred for full preview support)
  
**Installation Instructions**
1. Download and extract the project `.zip` file.
2. Using Google Web Designerâ€™s open `Storybook_Demo.html` in the file.
3. Click preview on the top right and select Chrome.
